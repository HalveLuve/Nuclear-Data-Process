# Nuclear-Data-Process

## To start with

Currently, this data processing procedure needs `matio` and `GNUplot`. So first make sure that they are installed and configured correctly.

### Linux

```sh
sudo apt-get install libmatio-dev
sudo apt-get install gnuplot
```
>WSL supported

### macOS

```sh
brew install libmatio
brew install gnuplot
```
>BREW required on macOS

## Run

Bash file `data.sh` contains the necessary commands for running the scripts

```sh
sh data.sh
```

It's worth noting that data are not uploaded ~~until we make any progress~~.
